# Title
Simulations of measurements of secondary organic aerosol

# Introduction
Bloggs et al have researched into this area extensively but they haven't addressed question X (Bloggs et al 2012). 
We present here measurements which shed some light on question X.
We used an aerosol spectrometer to measure the chemical composition of aerosol particles (Allen et al 2004).

# Simulations
We ran an atmospheric model to simulate formation of aerosol particles.
