# Title
Measurement - model comparison of secondary organic aerosol over West Africa

# Introduction
Bloggs et al have researched into this area extensively but they haven't addressed question X (Bloggs et al 2012). 
We present here measurements which shed some light on question X.
We used an aerosol spectrometer to measure the chemical composition of aerosol particles (Allen et al 2004).

# Simulations
We ran an atmospheric model to simulate formation of aerosol particles. 

# Instrumentation
The Aerosol Mass Spectrometer is described in Allen et al 2003.

# Further Simulations
The authors note that the universe is defo a simulation itself and think that's worth mentioning just in case it's important.

# Results
Our simulations did a good job of reproducing the measurements. This means we think we nderstand what's going on.
